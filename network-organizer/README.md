TODO:
* UI: 
 - Tabs for People, Orgs, etc.

* Node cards: 
   - Should be able to edit node's properties
   - Should be able to link to existing other nodes or create new ones.  Same interface.
     * Prepopulate created node types based on other links from nodes of same type (e.g. if :Person-[:WorksFor]->:Organization then adding a :WorksFor link should show the creation card for :Organization)
     * Example: Adding a note to someone
    
* Way to "explore" the graph.  (Force layout?  Browser "pages"?)
* Collection cards: Pagination
