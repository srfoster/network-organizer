* Collection cards: Make AddNode Component type-aware (should check properties of other similar nodes of that type?  Or hardcode somewhere)

* UI:

 - Way to "explore" the graph.  (Force layout?  Browser "pages"?)

* Node cards: Use should be able to add links from there (prepopulate based on other links from nodes of same type).
   - Should be able to edit node's properties
   - Should be able to link to existing other nodes or create new ones.  Same interface.
     * Example: Adding a note to someone
    
* Collection cards: Pagination
